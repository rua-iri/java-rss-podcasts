# java-rss-podcasts

Project to parse an rss feed and return information about the given podcast, its episodes etc.

I had been wanting to create a desktop application lately and I quite like podcasts, so this project seemed like a good idea

Eventually plan to add a feature which implements a audio player in the application.
